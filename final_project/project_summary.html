			<h1>Final Project Summary</h1>
			<hr>
			<h2>Topic</h2>
			<p>The Topic of my shoes are shoes. It explores the world of the most common shoes in the world from the most famous brands at the moment and it also looks at some signature sneakers from some of the most famous basketball players in the NBA. I have 4 pages: Home, Brands, Signature and an Easter Egg Page. The Home page gives a overall introduction to shoes as well as pictures on the bottom to lead to other pages. The Brands page explores the most common shoes from the most famous brands in the world. Each of them have a description under them as well as a link to the shoe. The Signature page is a page that explores signature sneakers created for NBA players from the specific brands in the brands page. The Easter Egg page is a "hidden" page that is linked to the logo on the top left of the page. It is "hidden" because some people see the home page in the bar on the top left and think there is no other pages. The page will contain both my extras.</p>

			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>The purpose of the page is to expose the audience to the diverse world of shoes. It is something we wear everyday and more people shoe be more attentive to the things they use so often. Of course my page does not include all the aspects of shoes. There is still cushion, technology, fashion and a whole lot of other things. THe overall purpose is to show people there is so much to learn about the world of shoes as well as inspire them to look at the world themselves. The website is supposed to bring some laughter to peoples faces as I added in some jokes on the easter egg page as well as the brands page. It also has the personal touch of a story in the New Balance section.</p>

			<h2>Extras</h2>
			<p>In my easter egg page, I feature both my extras: iframes and a form. Once you click on the logo on the top left, it will direct you to the easter egg page. The iframe is a youtube video from weartesters where they talk about where and how to get cheap shoes. It is a bonus for people that find the page to get the tips in the video. The form is to send 500 million dollars to the person as a added bonus to finding the page.</p>
